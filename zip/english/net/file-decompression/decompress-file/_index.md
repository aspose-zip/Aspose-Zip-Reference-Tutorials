# Decompressing a File with Aspose.Zip for .NET

## Introduction

In the world of .NET development, managing compressed files efficiently is crucial. Aspose.Zip for .NET provides a powerful solution to handle file compression and decompression seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of decompressing a file using Aspose.Zip for .NET. Follow along to unlock the potential of this powerful library.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Zip for .NET: Make sure you have the library installed. You can find the documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment with the necessary tools installed.

- Your Document Directory: Choose a directory where you'll be working with the compressed files.

## Import Namespaces

First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces to kickstart our decompression process:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Zip.Lzip;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Your Document Directory

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Make sure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path where your compressed file is located.

## Step 2: Open and Extract from Lzip Archive

Now, let's dive into the heart of the process. We'll open an Lzip archive and extract its contents:

```csharp
//ExStart: OpenLzipArchive
using (var archive = new LzipArchive(Path.Combine(dataDir, "archive.lz")))
{
    using (var extracted = File.Create(Path.Combine(dataDir, "output.txt")))
    {
        archive.Extract(extracted);
    }
}
//ExEnd: OpenLzipArchive
Console.WriteLine("Successfully Opened Lzip Archive");
```

This step initializes an instance of the `LzipArchive` class, opens the specified archive file, and extracts its content to an output file.
