string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Decompress a RAR Entry

```csharp
//ExStart: DecompressRarEntry
using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead(dataDir + "your_file.rar"))
{
    using (RarArchive archive = new RarArchive(fs))
    {
        archive.Entries[0].Extract(dataDir + "extracted_file.txt");
    }
}
//ExEnd: DecompressRarEntry
