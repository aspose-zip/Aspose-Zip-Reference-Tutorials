# Decompress AES Files - Aspose.Zip .NET Tutorial


## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on decompressing AES encrypted files using Aspose.Zip for .NET! Aspose.Zip is a powerful library that simplifies working with compressed files in your .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll focus on decompressing AES encrypted files step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A basic understanding of C# programming.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Zip for .NET library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/zip/net/).
- A sample AES encrypted ZIP file for hands-on practice.

## Import Namespaces

In your C# project, start by importing the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.Zip functionalities:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Zip;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Create a new C# project in Visual Studio and include the Aspose.Zip library. Make sure you have a sample AES encrypted ZIP file in your project directory.

## Step 2: Initialize Variables

Set the path to your resource directory and create variables for file paths:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YourDocumentDirectory";
```

## Step 3: Decompress AES Encrypted File

Now, let's get into the core of decompressing AES encrypted files. Use the following code snippet:

```csharp
//ExStart: DecompressAESEncryptedFile
using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead(dataDir + "PasswordProtectWithAES256_out.zip"))
{
    using (var extracted = File.Create(dataDir + "alice_aesextracted_out.txt"))
    {
        using (Archive archive = new Archive(fs))
        {
            using (var decompressed = archive.Entries[0].Open("p@s$"))
            {
                byte[] b = new byte[8192];
                int bytesRead;
                while (0 < (bytesRead = decompressed.Read(b, 0, b.Length)))
                {
                    extracted.Write(b, 0, bytesRead);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
//ExEnd: DecompressAESEncryptedFile
```

This code opens a ZIP file, extracts its content, and decompresses the encrypted file using the specified password.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to decompress AES encrypted files using Aspose.Zip for .NET. This powerful library simplifies working with compressed files in your .NET applications.
