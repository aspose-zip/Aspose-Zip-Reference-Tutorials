# Secure File Compression in .NET with Aspose.Zip


## Introduction

In the world of .NET development, managing and compressing files efficiently is a crucial task. Aspose.Zip for .NET provides a powerful solution for file compression, offering various features to enhance your applications. One notable feature is the ability to compress files with individual passwords, providing an added layer of security. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of compressing files with individual passwords using Aspose.Zip for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.Zip for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Zip library installed in your .NET project. You can find the necessary documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/).

- Download: If you haven't already, download the Aspose.Zip for .NET library from [this link](https://releases.aspose.com/zip/net/).

- Document Directory: Prepare a directory containing the files you want to compress.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, make sure to import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Zip;
using Aspose.Zip.Saving;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Set the Resource Directory Path

Define the path to the resource directory where your files are located.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Compress Files with Individual Passwords

Now, let's compress files with individual passwords. We'll use three sample files (`alice29.txt`, `asyoulik.txt`, and `fields.c`) with distinct passwords for each.

```csharp
using (FileStream zipFile = File.Open(dataDir + "CompressFilesWithIndividualPasswords_out.zip", FileMode.Create))
{
    FileInfo source1 = new FileInfo(dataDir + "alice29.txt");
    FileInfo source2 = new FileInfo(dataDir + "asyoulik.txt");
    FileInfo source3 = new FileInfo(dataDir + "fields.c");

    using (var archive = new Archive())
    {
        // Compress each file with an individual password
        archive.CreateEntry("alice29.txt", source1, true, new ArchiveEntrySettings(new DeflateCompressionSettings(), new TraditionalEncryptionSettings("pass1")));
        archive.CreateEntry("asyoulik.txt", source2, true, new ArchiveEntrySettings(new DeflateCompressionSettings(), new AesEcryptionSettings("pass2", EncryptionMethod.AES128)));
        archive.CreateEntry("fields.c", source3, true, new ArchiveEntrySettings(new DeflateCompressionSettings(), new AesEcryptionSettings("pass3", EncryptionMethod.AES256)));
        
        // Save the compressed files
        archive.Save(zipFile);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to compress files with individual passwords using Aspose.Zip for .NET. This feature adds an extra layer of security to your compressed files, ensuring confidentiality.
