# Aspose.Zip for .NET - Decrypting AES Encrypted Files


## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on decompressing AES encrypted stored files using Aspose.Zip for .NET. Aspose.Zip is a powerful .NET library that enables developers to work with compressed files effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll focus on decompressing files that are AES encrypted, providing you with a clear understanding of the process.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Zip for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Zip library installed. You can find the documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/).

- Sample AES Encrypted File: Download a sample AES encrypted file from [this link](https://releases.aspose.com/zip/net/).

- Your Document Directory: Set up a directory where you want to store the decompressed file. Replace "Your Document Directory" in the code snippet with your actual directory path.

## Import Namespaces

In the code snippet provided, you'll notice the usage of various namespaces. Make sure to include these in your project:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Zip;
```

## Step 1: Define the Resource Directory

Ensure that you specify the path to your resource directory. In the example, replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Open the Encrypted Archive

```csharp
using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead(dataDir + "StoreMutlipleFilesWithoutCompressionWithPassword_out.zip"))
{
    using (var extracted = File.Create(dataDir + "alice_aesextracted_out.txt"))
    {
        using (Archive archive = new Archive(fs, new ArchiveLoadOptions() { DecryptionPassword = "p@s$" }))
        {
            // Continue to the next steps...
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Decompress the Encrypted Entry

```csharp
using (var decompressed = archive.Entries[0].Open())
{
    byte[] b = new byte[8192];
    int bytesRead;
    while (0 < (bytesRead = decompressed.Read(b, 0, b.Length)))
    {
        extracted.Write(b, 0, bytesRead);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to decompress AES encrypted stored files using Aspose.Zip for .NET. This process allows you to efficiently work with encrypted archives in your .NET applications.
