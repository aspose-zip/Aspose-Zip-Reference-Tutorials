# Entries with Different Passwords in Aspose.Zip for .NET

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.Zip for .NET, a powerful library that empowers developers to manage and manipulate ZIP archives seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll delve into a specific feature: working with entries with different passwords. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, unlocking the potential of Aspose.Zip for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the exciting world of managing ZIP archives with varying passwords, ensure you have the following:

- Aspose.Zip for .NET: Make sure you have the library installed. If not, you can find the necessary information in the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/).
- Document Directory: Set up a directory to store your documents.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# will be beneficial as we will be using it for coding.

## Import Namespaces

In order to begin, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your C# project. This ensures that you have access to the functionality provided by Aspose.Zip for .NET.

```csharp
using Aspose.Zip.Saving;
using Aspose.Zip.SevenZip;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

## Step 1: Set Your Document Directory

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create Entries with Different Passwords

Now, let's get into the core functionality of creating entries with different passwords in Aspose.Zip for .NET.

```csharp
//ExStart: EntriesWithDifferentPasswords
using (FileStream sevenZipFile = File.Open("archive.7z", FileMode.Create))
{
    FileInfo fi1 = new FileInfo("data1.bin");
    FileInfo fi2 = new FileInfo("data2.bin");
    FileInfo fi3 = new FileInfo("data3.bin");

    using (var archive = new SevenZipArchive())
    {
        archive.CreateEntry("entry1.bin", fi1, false, new SevenZipEntrySettings(new SevenZipStoreCompressionSettings(), new SevenZipAESEncryptionSettings("test1")));
        archive.CreateEntry("entry2.bin", fi2, false, new SevenZipEntrySettings(new SevenZipStoreCompressionSettings(), new SevenZipAESEncryptionSettings("test2")));
        archive.CreateEntry("entry3.bin", fi3, false, new SevenZipEntrySettings(new SevenZipStoreCompressionSettings(), new SevenZipAESEncryptionSettings("test3")));
        
        archive.Save(sevenZipFile);
    }
}
//ExEnd: EntriesWithDifferentPasswords
```

## Step 3: Verification

After executing the code, check your console to ensure that the Seven Zip file with AES encryption settings has been successfully created.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Successfully Created a Seven Zip File with AES Encryption Settings");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've now mastered the art of working with entries having different passwords in Aspose.Zip for .NET. This powerful capability opens doors to enhanced security and flexibility when managing ZIP archives in your applications.
