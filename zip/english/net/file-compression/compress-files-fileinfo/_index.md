# Compress Files using FileInfo in Aspose.Zip for .NET

## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on compressing files using Aspose.Zip for .NET! If you're looking to optimize your file storage or transmission, Aspose.Zip is your go-to solution. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of compressing files using the FileInfo class, providing a detailed step-by-step guide. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Zip for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Zip library installed. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/zip/net/).

2. Document Directory: Set up a directory on your system to store the files you want to compress.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, include the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Zip;
using Aspose.Zip.Saving;
using Aspose.ZIP;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First things first, define the directory where your documents are stored. You can use the following code:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Compress Files using FileInfo

Now, let's get into the core of the process. We'll use the `FileInfo` class along with Aspose.Zip to compress files. Follow these steps:

### Step 2.1: Open a Zip File

```csharp
using (FileStream zipFile = File.Open(dataDir + "CompressFilesByFileInfo_out.zip", FileMode.Create))
{
```

### Step 2.2: Create FileInfo Objects

Create `FileInfo` objects for the files you want to compress:

```csharp
FileInfo fi1 = new FileInfo(dataDir + "alice29.txt");
FileInfo fi2 = new FileInfo(dataDir + "fields.c");
```

### Step 2.3: Create Archive and Add Entries

```csharp
using (var archive = new Archive())
{
    archive.CreateEntry("alice29.txt", fi1);
    archive.CreateEntry("fields.c", fi2);
```

### Step 2.4: Save the Zip File

```csharp
    archive.Save(zipFile, new ArchiveSaveOptions() { Encoding = Encoding.ASCII });
}
```

Congratulations! You've successfully compressed files using the FileInfo class in Aspose.Zip for .NET.
