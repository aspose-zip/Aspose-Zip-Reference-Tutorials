# Storing Multiple Files Without Compression in Aspose.Zip for .NET

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of .NET development, effective file compression is crucial for optimizing storage and transmission of data. Aspose.Zip for .NET is a powerful tool that simplifies this process, allowing developers to efficiently store multiple files without compression. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process, step by step, ensuring you harness the full potential of Aspose.Zip for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Zip for .NET: Make sure you've integrated Aspose.Zip for .NET into your project. If not, you can refer to the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/) for guidance.

- Development Environment: Have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.

- Document Directory: Identify the directory where your documents are stored. In the example, we'll use the placeholder "Your Document Directory."

## Import Namespaces

Before we begin coding, let's import the necessary namespaces to ensure a smooth coding experience:

```csharp
using Aspose.Zip;
using Aspose.Zip.Saving;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Set Document Directory

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path where your documents are stored.

## Step 2: Create Zip Archive Without Compression

```csharp
using (FileStream zipFile = File.Open(dataDir + "StoreMultipleFilesWithoutCompression_out.zip", FileMode.Create))
{
    FileInfo fi1 = new FileInfo(dataDir + "alice29.txt");
    FileInfo fi2 = new FileInfo(dataDir + "lcet10.txt");

    using (Archive archive = new Archive(new ArchiveEntrySettings(new StoreCompressionSettings())))
    {
        archive.CreateEntry("alice29.txt", fi1);
        archive.CreateEntry("lcet10.txt", fi2);
        archive.Save(zipFile, new ArchiveSaveOptions() { Encoding = Encoding.ASCII });
    }
}
```

This code snippet creates a zip archive without compressing the specified files ("alice29.txt" and "lcet10.txt"). Adjust the file names and paths according to your project structure.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to store multiple files without compression using Aspose.Zip for .NET. This efficient approach ensures optimal file management in your .NET applications.
