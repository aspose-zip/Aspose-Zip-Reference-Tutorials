### Common Pitfalls & Tips
- **Choosing the wrong method:** LZMA2 offers the best compression but can be slower on large files. Use BZip2 when you need a balance, and Store when speed is critical.  
- **Memory consumption:** High‑compression methods may require more RAM; monitor resources for very large archives.  
- **File names:** SevenZip archives are case‑sensitive; ensure consistent naming to avoid extraction issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I add password protection to a SevenZip archive?**  
A: Yes. Aspose.Zip lets you set a password on the archive or individual entries for added security.

**Q: How do I extract a specific entry without decompressing the whole archive?**  
A: Use the `ExtractEntry` method, which streams the requested entry directly to a target stream.

**Q: Is it possible to update an existing 7z file?**  
A: Absolutely. Aspose.Zip supports adding, removing, or updating entries in an existing archive without recreating it from scratch.

**Q: What are the performance differences between LZMA2 and BZip2?**  
A: LZMA2 generally provides better compression ratios but may be slower on CPU‑intensive scenarios. BZip2 is faster but yields larger files.

**Q: Do I need to dispose of any objects manually?**  
A: The `Archive` class implements `IDisposable`. Wrap it in a `using` statement or call `Dispose()` to release resources promptly.
