## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on compressing multiple files with traditional encryption using Aspose.Zip for .NET. Aspose.Zip is a powerful library that enables developers to work with zip archives seamlessly in their .NET applications. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of compressing multiple files with traditional encryption, ensuring the security of your data.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Zip for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Zip library for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/zip/net/).

- Your Document Directory: Replace `"Your Document Directory"` in the code snippet with the actual path to your document directory.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET application, start by importing the necessary namespaces. This will allow you to access the functionality provided by Aspose.Zip. Here's an example:

```csharp
using Aspose.Zip;
using Aspose.Zip.Saving;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Zip File

Create a new zip file using the `Archive` class. In this step, you'll also define traditional encryption settings, providing a password for added security.

```csharp
//ExStart: CompressMultipleFilesWithTraditionalEncryption
using (FileStream zipFile = File.Open(".\\CompressMultipleFilesWithTraditionalEncryption_out.zip", FileMode.Create))
{
    // Create archive with traditional encryption settings
    using (var archive = new Archive(new ArchiveEntrySettings(null, new TraditionalEncryptionSettings("p@s$"))))
    {
        // Continue to the next step...
    }
}
//ExEnd: CompressMultipleFilesWithTraditionalEncryption
```

## Step 2: Add Files to the Archive

Now, add the files you want to compress to the archive. In this example, we're adding three files: "alice29.txt," "asyoulik.txt," and "fields.c."

```csharp
archive.CreateEntry("alice29.txt", source1);
archive.CreateEntry("asyoulik.txt", source2);
archive.CreateEntry("fields.c", source3);
```

## Step 3: Save the Zip File

Save the zip file with the added entries. This step finalizes the compression process.

```csharp
archive.Save(zipFile);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully compressed multiple files with traditional encryption using Aspose.Zip for .NET.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to leverage Aspose.Zip for .NET to compress multiple files with traditional encryption. This process ensures the security of your data while efficiently managing zip archives in your .NET applications.
