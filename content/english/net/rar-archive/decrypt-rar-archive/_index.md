## Introduction

Unlocking the contents of a password-protected RAR archive can be a daunting task, but with Aspose.Zip for .NET, the process becomes straightforward and efficient. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps of decrypting a RAR archive using the Aspose.Zip library. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a coding enthusiast, this guide will help you seamlessly integrate decryption functionality into your .NET applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Zip for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Zip library installed in your .NET project. You can download it from the [Aspose.Zip documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/).

2. Document Directory: Set up a directory where your encrypted RAR archive is located. Replace "Your Document Directory" in the example code with the actual path to this directory.

## Import Namespaces

Let's start by importing the necessary namespaces to use the Aspose.Zip library effectively. Add the following lines to the top of your .NET file:

```csharp
//ExStart: ImportNamespaces
using Aspose.Zip;
using System.IO;
//ExEnd: ImportNamespaces
```

## Step 1: Open the Encrypted RAR Archive

Begin by opening the encrypted RAR archive. In the example code, replace "encrypted.rar" with the name of your encrypted RAR file.

```csharp
//ExStart: DecryptRarArchive_Step1
using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead(dataDir + "encrypted.rar"))
{
    //ExEnd: DecryptRarArchive_Step1
    // Continue to the next step here...
}
```

## Step 2: Specify Decryption Password

Specify the decryption password for the RAR archive. In the example, the password "p@s$" is used. Replace it with the actual password you set for your encrypted RAR file.

```csharp
//ExStart: DecryptRarArchive_Step2
using (RarArchive archive = new RarArchive(fs, new RarArchiveLoadOptions() { DecryptionPassword = "p@s$" }))
{
    //ExEnd: DecryptRarArchive_Step2
    // Continue to the next step here...
}
```

## Step 3: Extract Contents to Directory

Now, extract the contents of the RAR archive to a specified directory. Replace "DecompressRar_out" with the path where you want the decrypted files to be stored.

```csharp
//ExStart: DecryptRarArchive_Step3
archive.ExtractToDirectory(dataDir + "DecompressRar_out");
//ExEnd: DecryptRarArchive_Step3
```

Repeat these steps for each RAR archive you need to decrypt, ensuring a seamless integration of Aspose.Zip for .NET into your project.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully decrypted a RAR archive using Aspose.Zip for .NET. This powerful library simplifies the complex process of unlocking password-protected archives, making it an invaluable tool for developers working with .NET applications.
