## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, Aspose.Zip stands as a robust solution for handling compressed files with finesse. This tutorial will guide you through the process of decompressing a single file using Aspose.Zip for .NET. Strap in as we unravel the capabilities of this powerful library step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Zip for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [Aspose.Zip for .NET Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/zip/net/).

- Development Environment: Have a functional .NET development environment ready, including Visual Studio or any other compatible IDE.

- Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarize yourself with the basics of C# programming.

Now, let's get our hands dirty with some code!

## Import Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces to kick off your Aspose.Zip journey:

```csharp
using Aspose.Zip;
using System;
using System.IO;
```

## Decompressing a Single File with Aspose.Zip for .NET

### Step 1: Set Your Document Directory

Begin by specifying the directory where your documents are stored. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

### Step 2: Create a Compressed File

Utilize the following code snippet to create a compressed file that we will later decompress.

```csharp
CompressSingleFile.Run();
```

### Step 3: Decompress the File

Now, let's dive into the heart of the matter â€“ decompressing the single file. Use the following code:

```csharp
// ExStart: DecompressSingleFile
using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead(dataDir + "CompressSingleFile_out.zip"))
{
    using (Archive archive = new Archive(fs))
    {
        int percentReady = 0;
        archive.Entries[0].ExtractionProgressed += (s, e) =>
        {
            int percent = (int)((100 * e.ProceededBytes) / ((ArchiveEntry)s).UncompressedSize);
            if (percent > percentReady)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(string.Format("{0}% decompressed", percent));
                percentReady = percent;
            }
        };
        archive.Entries[0].Extract(dataDir + "alice_extracted_out.txt");
    }
}
```

This code efficiently handles the decompression process, providing real-time progress updates.
