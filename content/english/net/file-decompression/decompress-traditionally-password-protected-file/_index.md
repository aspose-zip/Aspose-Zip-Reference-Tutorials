In the realm of .NET development, Aspose.Zip stands out as a robust solution for handling compressed files. Among its myriad features, one prominent capability is the ability to decompress traditionally password-protected files. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of decompressing a file encrypted with a traditional password using Aspose.Zip for .NET. Before we embark on this journey, let's ensure we have the prerequisites in place.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into decompressing traditionally password-protected files, make sure you have the following prerequisites in order:

## Import Namespaces

Firstly, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the Aspose.Zip functionalities. Include the following namespaces in your .NET project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Zip;
using System.IO;
```

Now, let's break down the process into step-by-step instructions.

## Step 1: Run Password Protection on a File

Before we can decompress a traditionally password-protected file, let's set the stage by applying password protection to a file. Utilize the following code snippet to achieve this:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
PasswordProtectArchiveWithTraditionalPassword.Run(); // Run password protection on a file example to use it later
```

Ensure that you replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual directory where your document is located.

## Step 2: Decompress Traditionally Password-Protected File

Now that we have a file with traditional password protection, let's proceed with the decompression process. The code snippet below illustrates how to achieve this:

```csharp
// ExStart: DecompressTraditionallyPasswordProtectedFile
using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead(dataDir + "CompressWithTraditionalEncryption_out.zip"))
{
    using (var extracted = File.Create(dataDir + "alice_extracted_out.txt"))
    {
        using (Archive archive = new Archive(fs, new ArchiveLoadOptions() { DecryptionPassword = "p@s$" }))
        {
            using (var decompressed = archive.Entries[0].Open())
            {
                byte[] b = new byte[8192];
                int bytesRead;
                while (0 < (bytesRead = decompressed.Read(b, 0, b.Length)))
                {
                    extracted.Write(b, 0, bytesRead);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// ExEnd: DecompressTraditionallyPasswordProtectedFile
```

In this code snippet:
- We open the compressed file stream.
- Create an output file stream for the decompressed content.
- Instantiate an `Archive` object with decryption password provided.
- Open the first entry in the archive (assuming there's only one entry).
- Read and write the decompressed content into the output file.

Congratulations! You've successfully decompressed a traditionally password-protected file using Aspose.Zip for .NET.
