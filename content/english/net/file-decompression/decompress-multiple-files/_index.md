## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on decompressing multiple files using Aspose.Zip for .NET! If you're looking to efficiently handle compressed files containing multiple entries, you're in the right place. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process step by step, using Aspose.Zip for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Zip for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Zip library for .NET installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/zip/net/).

- Document Directory: Set up a directory where your documents are stored. You'll use this as the base directory in the code.

Now, let's get started with the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces for Aspose.Zip:

```csharp
using Aspose.Zip;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

## Step 1: Compressing Multiple Files

To decompress multiple files, you first need a compressed file with multiple entries. Let's create one:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Run the compression method
CompressMultipleFiles.Run();
```

## Step 2: Decompressing the Files

Now, let's decompress the files step by step:

### Step 2.1: Opening the Compressed File

```csharp
using (FileStream zipFile = File.Open(dataDir + "CompressMultipleFiles_out.zip", FileMode.Open))
{
    // ...
}
```

### Step 2.2: Listing Entries and Tracking Progress

```csharp
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Entries are: ");
int percentReady = 0;

using (Archive archive = new Archive(zipFile, new ArchiveLoadOptions()
{
    EntryListed = (s, e) => { sb.AppendFormat("{0}, ", e.Entry.Name); },
    EntryExtractionProgressed = (s, e) =>
    {
        int percent = (int)((100 * e.ProceededBytes) / ((ArchiveEntry)s).UncompressedSize);
        if (percent > percentReady)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(string.Format("{0}% compressed", percent));
            percentReady = percent;
        }
    }
}))
{
    Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString(0, sb.Length - 2));
```

### Step 2.3: Extracting the First Entry

```csharp
using (var extracted = File.Create(dataDir + "alice_extracted_out.txt"))
{
    using (var decompressed = archive.Entries[0].Open())
    {
        // Read and write data from decompressed stream to the extracting file.
    }
}
```

### Step 2.4: Extracting the Second Entry

```csharp
archive.Entries[1].Extract(dataDir + "asyoulik_extracted_out.txt");
```

And there you have it! You've successfully decompressed multiple files using Aspose.Zip for .NET.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered the essential steps to decompress multiple files using Aspose.Zip for .NET. By following this guide, you can efficiently manage compressed files with ease.
