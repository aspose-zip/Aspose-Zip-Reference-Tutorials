## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, handling compressed files efficiently is a critical aspect. Aspose.Zip for .NET emerges as a robust solution, providing developers with powerful tools to decompress stored files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of decompressing a stored file using Aspose.Zip for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Zip for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.Zip for .NET library. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/zip/net/).

- Document Directory: Create a directory in your system where you'll store the necessary files for this tutorial.

## Import Namespaces

To kick things off, let's import the required namespaces for our project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Zip;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Creating a Stored File Without Compression

Before we can decompress a stored file, we need to have one ready. Execute the following code to create a stored file without compression:

```csharp
StoreMultipleFilesWithoutCompression.Run();
```

This step generates a stored file named `StoreMultipleFilesWithoutCompression_out.zip` in the specified document directory.

## Step 2: Decompressing the Stored File

Now, let's dive into the core of our tutorialâ€”decompressing the stored file. Follow these steps:

### Step 2.1: Opening the Zip File

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

using (FileStream zipFile = File.Open(dataDir + "StoreMultipleFilesWithoutCompression_out.zip", FileMode.Open))
{
    using (Archive archive = new Archive(zipFile))
    {
```

### Step 2.2: Creating Extracted Files

```csharp
        using (var extracted = File.Create(dataDir + "alice_extracted_store_out.txt"))
        {
            using (var decompressed = archive.Entries[0].Open())
            {
                byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
                int bytesRead;

                // Reading from decompressed stream to extracting file.
                while (0 < (bytesRead = decompressed.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)))
                {
                    extracted.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                }
            }
        }
```

### Step 2.3: Repeating the Process for Another File

```csharp
        using (var extracted = File.Create(dataDir + "asyoulik_extracted_store_out.txt"))
        {
            using (var decompressed = archive.Entries[1].Open())
            {
                byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
                int bytesRead;

                // Reading from decompressed stream to extracting file.
                while (0 < (bytesRead = decompressed.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)))
                {
                    extracted.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
